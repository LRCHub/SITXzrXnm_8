```
Ooh～
Hoo ahh～
Yeah
Mirrors reflection, going under.
Confused obsession.
I still wonder
if I was made for you,
if I could only see, oh please
[Oh!]
Make me up, a new
Persona, calculated
Perfectly for you
Pretending like it's all just
for me? Don't think so
Live life incognito
Oh I play god
and yet I'm asking why
You never see what I want,
what I need
Oh, do you?
[no no]
Oh, do you?
[No～]
Follow through,
light you pursue but now
Ahh～
You sold me on a mirage
I tore you up into shreds
I don't even know
what to do with this mess
Tell me the cost
Sit, be good
play your part, my mirage
My Mirage
Livin' with regrets
[Told you I'd do anything]
Better left unsaid
Thought I'd be the king and
queen of newfound paradise
I'm beggin' you to see
I'm you, you're all of me
It seems like everyone wants it
[All around around,
runnin' round and round,
on and on]
This cycle keepin' me captive
[Escape my way]
You say I'm way too fragile
I'm just your perfect idol
Break me, Shape me, I～
You never see what I want,
what I need
Oh, do you?
[no no]
Oh, do you?
[No～]
Follow through,
light you pursue but now
Ahh～
You sold me on a mirage
I tore you up into shreds
I don't even know what to do
with this mess
Tell me the cost
Sit be good, play your part,
my mirage
MY MIRAGE
Mi-mi-mimi-mirage you
Spinnin' little lies,
new disguise, on and on
And on
And on
And on
This mirage, I'm lost
Who owns your heart? MIRAGE
Who
You, You
You make me fall in line～
[Oh! You, You]
[Oh my ending]
You
[Made]
[Me]
[Made]
You～ No Oh!
You sold me on a mirage
I tore you up into shreds
I don't even know what to do
with this mess
Tell me the cost
Sit be good, play your part,
my mirage
MY MIRAGE
Mi-mi-mimi-mirage you
Spinnin' little lies,
new disguise, on and on
And on
And on
And on
This mirage, I'm lost
Who owns your heart? MIRAGE
